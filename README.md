#InsuraPredict - Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

ðŸš€ InsuraPredict is a machine learning model designed to predict medical insurance costs based on factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. By analyzing patterns in historical data, the model helps insurance providers, healthcare professionals, and individuals estimate insurance premiums with higher accuracy.

Features
âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Understanding key factors affecting insurance costs
âœ… Multiple ML Models â€“ Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
âœ… Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Optimizing model performance for better accuracy
âœ… Model Evaluation â€“ Using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score for performance assessment
âœ… Interactive Data Visualizations

Technologies Used
ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning (Supervised Regression)
